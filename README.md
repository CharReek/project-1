# A Dogs Life

A dogs life is a site for those who want to get the best out of their dogs diet and explore new ways in which food can benefit their dogs life. The aim of this site is to provide reciepes and information for those who are wanting to introduce more natural and helthy alternatives into their dogs diet. The idea behind this site is that its very overwhelming as a dog owner to find the right information and reciepes that are safe for dogs. Like me many owner like to know what is going into their dogs treats so providing a portal for recipes to be all in one easy accesible will give owns an option to make their own treeats and tailor them to what their dog likes.
