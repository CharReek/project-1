# A Dogs Life

A dogs life is a site for those who want to get the best out of their dogs diet and explore new ways in which food can benefit their dogs life. The aim of this site is to provide reciepes and information for those who are wanting to introduce more natural and helthy alternatives into their dogs diet. The idea behind this site is that its very overwhelming as a dog owner to find the right information and reciepes that are safe for dogs. Like me many owner like to know what is going into their dogs treats so providing a portal for recipes to be all in one easy accesible will give owns an option to make their own treeats and tailor them to what their dog likes.

    * The implimentation of the navigation bar that features on all 3 of pages of the site allow for site viewer to easily be able to navigate from page to page therfore resulting in them spending more time on the site exploring all the different features. 
    * This feautre being in the same place on all pages means the site viewer will be able to find this easily and will avoid any confusion that may lead to a negative user experience.

    * The use of the text feautre on top of the image gives a brief description of what the site is about. The orange background helps make the text stand out from the picture so it is easily readable.

### Features left to impliment
 * I would like to implement more reciepes into the recipe page so users have more choice regarding recipes. 
 * Another section i would want to add is a blog styled page where users can keep up to date on all the activites and foods that Sam and I try. 
 * In the future i would like to impliment a Chat/ Forum function so people can connect with one and another and discuss what recipes they have that they like and other tips for a healthy dog.


## Testing
When it came to testing my site page i have ensured that all the pages work are are linked properly, i also tested the social media links to make sure that these all worked and opened in a new tab. 
* I tested this on chrome, edge and on mobile devices
* I tested that is was recponsive on all devices using dev tools 

### Bugs 
When i deployed my page i diecovered that my pictures were not visible due to using an absolut file path instead of a relative style path. 
 * To fix this bug i changed all my image paths to relative paths by taking of the "/" at the begining 
  * Once i had made these changes the pictures shows on the brower

Another issue i found that was when i tested the page on my personal device the pictures did not show up in the place i wanted them to. 
  * I fixed this by making changed to my responsive design so the the pictures were where i wanted them and were not cut of the edge of the screen when on a smaller device.
  * I replaced my header and heading text so that everything was readable on a phone.

I deployed my site using github using the following process: 
1. Go to your git hub repositories and click on the repository you want to deploy 
2. Go into the settings page, this can be found across the top bar 
3. Then find the pages tab, this can be located on the left hand side
4. Once you are on the pages tab find the source section.
5. The source section will contain a drop down menu.
6. From this drop down menu select the main branch
7. After you have done this click save. 
8. The page will then refresh and a banner will appear with the live link to your page 
9. Finally click the link and this will take you to the live page.
